# Rivals2-Replay_Slowmo
 Allows Rivals 2 players to change the playback speed of replays. Ideal for cinematics and moviemaking.

## Installation

1. Install [UE4SS for Rivals 2](https://gamebanana.com/tools/18505)
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cellarghost/Rivals2-Replay_Slowmo/releases).
3. Open the .zip, and place SlowMoMod.pak inside of the following directory:
steamapps\common\Rivals 2\Rivals2\Content\Paks\LogicMods
If the LogicMods folder doesn't exist, create it manually (make sure that UE4SS is installed correctly!).

## Usage
When the replay is paused, the speed controls should show in the top left.

If the speed controls still show when playing a sequence, make sure to pause the replay before playing the sequence.
